This individual project was created in my final year of university for my BSc in Information Systems in which I got a 100/100 score. The objective of the project was to design an application on React Native and use Google Firebase for the back-end and demonstrate the knowledge and understanding of what we had learnt in that course. I wanted to take things a step further and personalize my project by adding a personal touch to it. I believe that whatever a person does with their life, they should give back to the community with the skills they have obtained. Theres no point in wisdom or knowledge if not shared with others for benefit. To honor my values I created an application for my project which facilitates the donation process and makes it easier for users to donate their clothes to a charity organization of their choice. Have you ever cleared out your wadrobe and set aside a bag of clothes you wanted to donate but couldn't find the time to drop it off to a donation box or did not live near one? This application provides a door-to-door service to come collect your donation and drop it off to a donation drive/ box/ center of your choice so you don't have to! This way your clothes reach the people in need on time! This project idea was later developed for my capstone project : ) and now participated for an undergraduate competition : )
