It is a full- stack mobile application created using React Native and its libraries and components, and JavaScript for the front-end. For the back-end I used Google Firebase. I followed UI/UX design principles I learned from my UI/UX design course that I took in university to design the screens as well as the wireframes and pick a color palette.

This individual project was created in my final year of university for my BSc in Information Systems in which I got a 100/100 score. The objective of the project was to design an application using React Native and use Google Firebase for the back-end and demonstrate the knowledge and understanding of what we had learnt in that course.
